# How to Submit a Pull Request for an Integration

This guide will take you through the steps to contribute to our open-source code while creating your RudderStack integration. It will also make sure that your integration code fits into our existing code base without any issues.

To create and submit an integration, you must contribute to the following repositories:

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th style="text-align:left"><b>Repository</b>
      </th>
      <th style="text-align:left"><b>Link</b>
      </th>
      <th style="text-align:left"><b>Description</b>
      </th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td style="text-align:left">
        <p>RudderStack Transformer
          <br />
        </p>
        <p>
        </p>
      </td>
      <td style="text-align:left">

      </td>
      <td style="text-align:left">Transforms the standard RudderStack payload from a
        source to the required payload format by a downstream destination.</td>

      </td>
      <td style="text-align:left">

4. Click on **New pull request** in the RudderStack repository.
5. Click **Compare across forks** link.
6. Change the **Head Repository** to your forked repository and change **Compare** to be the associated branch name.
7. Make the necessary title or descriptions changes, for example, you can add tags such as WIP \(work in progress\), etc. to add work status.

## RudderStack Transformer

[**GitHub Repository Link**](https://github.com/rudderlabs/rudder-transformer)

The `rudder-transformer` repository is responsible for transforming the source payload into the required payload by the downstream destination. It contains huge amount of code and therefore, the following should be kept in mind when contributing to this repository:

* Format the code to match the existing structure. In case of any queries, [**Contact Us**](https://rudderstack.com/docs/user-guides/how-to-guides/how-to-submit-an-integration-pull-request#contact-us).
* Include any `eslint` logic at the top of the file.
* Include test cases that provide around 80% code coverage.

## RudderStack Control Plane Lite

[**GitHub Repository Link**](https://github.com/rudderlabs/config-generator)

The `config-generator` repository can be used to upload the settings required for configuring the integration. The best practice is to follow the pre-existing structure to the best of your ability and [**reach out to us**](https://rudderstack.com/join-rudderstack-slack-community), if any questions or concerns.

Also, note the following:

* Documentation should be in the `.mdx` format.
* Proper `regex` validation rules should be included for all text input fields.
* Icon file must be in `svg` format.

## RudderStack Documentation

[**GitHub Repository Link**](https://github.com/rudderlabs/rudderstack-docs)

The `rudderstack-docs` repository houses all the RudderStack documentation. Refer the [**Destination Template**](https://github.com/rudderlabs/rudderstack-docs/blob/master/DESTINATION_TEMPLATE.mdx) while creating the document for instructing the users on how to use the integration. It will help you understand the pre-defined structure for the document.

Also, note the following:

* Ensure that the document is detailed and thorough to avoid any confusion and errors. 
* Include clear and concise steps to set up, configure, and use your integration.
* Include tips and suggestions wherever possible.
